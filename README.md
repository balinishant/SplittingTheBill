# SplittingTheBill
A number of friends go camping every year at provincial parks. The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally, but it is not practical to have them share every expense as it occurs. So individuals in the group pay for particular things, like food, drinks, supplies, the camp site, parking, etc. After the camping trip, each personâ€™s expenses are tallied and money is exchanged so that the net cost to each is the same. In the past, this money exchange has been tedious and time consuming. Your job is to compute, from a list of expenses, the amount of money that each person must pay or be paid.
